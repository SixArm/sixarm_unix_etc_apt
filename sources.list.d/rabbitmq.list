# The word "testing" in this line refers to the state of our 
# release of RabbitMQ, not any particular Debian distribution. 
# You can use it with Debian stable, testing or unstable, as 
# well as with Ubuntu. We describe the release as "testing" 
# to emphasise that we release somewhat frequently.
#
# To avoid warnings about unsigned packages, add our public key 
# to your trusted key list using apt-key(8):
#
#    wget http://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc
#    sudo apt-key add rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc
#    apt-get update
#    apt-get install rabbitmq-server
